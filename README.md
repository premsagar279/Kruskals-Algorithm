# Minimum Spanning Tree
### It finds the minimum spanning tree of any graph using Kruskal's Algorithm and plot  a graph containing set of edges in required mst of Initial graph.

# Getting Started
### It is implemented in matlab.It includes six function andone main Script.... 
#### ->gin.m
This function takes input from user as source(src) Destination(dst) and Weight for each edge of graph followed by coordinates of 
each vertices using mouse click.It takes Argument as no of vertices and return graph with set of edges.

</p>

#### ->sort.m
It sort the graph crossponding to minimum weight of edge. It takes graph and no of vertices as input and return sorted graph

#### ->finds.m
It recursively finds parent of verices.

#### ->union.m
It takes set X and set Y as input and return union of X and Y.

#### ->label.m
It label the edge of graph with crossponding weight of edges and display the result by ploting graph.

#### ->disp_mst.m 
It display the require edges in Minimum Spanning Tree.

#### ->kruskals_main.m
It is main script which drive the whole program.
